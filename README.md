### Project Title
Investigate the Sakila DVD Rental relational database using SQL

### Project Description
This project focuses on constructing SQL queries using JOINs, aggregations, subqueries, Common Table Expressions, Window Functions to gain insights from DVD rentals data.
A PDF visual presentation was generated using the SQL queries results. The four questions I had were: <br />
1. What are the two most popular family friendly movies in terms of rental counts? <br />
2. For family friendly movies, what are the top two most frequent rental durations? <br />
3. For animation movies, what is the distribution of the movie length quartile? <br />
4. What are the monthly total payment amount for DVD rental by the top 10 paying customers? <br />     

### Files used
